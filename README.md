# 🐍 Snake-Water-Gun Game 🎮

This is a fun **mini Python project** that implements the classic **Snake-Water-Gun** game (similar to Rock-Paper-Scissors) where the player competes against the computer.

---

## ✨ **How It Works**

- The player chooses either **Snake**, **Water**, or **Gun**.
- The computer randomly picks one of the three options.
- Rules:
  - Snake drinks Water 🐍💧 → Snake wins
  - Gun shoots Snake 🔫🐍 → Gun wins
  - Water damages Gun 💧🔫 → Water wins
  - If both choose the same → It’s a tie!
